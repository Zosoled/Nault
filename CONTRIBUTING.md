# Contributing to Gnault

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Project Goals
1. Building a secure wallet by the community for the community
2. Keep with best practices in the Angular development community
3. Stay current with major developments in Angular and Angular-CLI
4. Sharing responsibility: The project should be seen as *our* wallet and be self maintained by the community

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, track issues, request features, and accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/Zosoled/Gnault/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Zosoled/Gnault/issues); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
